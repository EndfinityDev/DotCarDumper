# DotCarDumper
A simple dumper for .car files generated by Automation

The project is a Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 .Net Framework application made in the C# language.

# Usage
There are two ways to run the program:

1: Run the executable and select the file in the file dialog
   This will result in the output file to be placed in the same folder where the executable is located;

2: Drag the file onto the executable or pass it as an argument when running the executable
   This will place the output file in the folder where the chosen file is located;
   
The program accepts any file using the same serialization method .car files do. 
Therefore it can be used not only to open .car files but also to open some database entries (e.g. tech pool, fixtures, etc.)

# Disclaimer
The purpose of this program is purely educational, the intent is not to generate useful data but to show an example of how data can be extracted.
